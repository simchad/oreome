## PL02 - Evolution to Micro-to-nano proteomics toward prceision oncology
__Keywords: precision medicine, DIA-MS, iProChip, EGFR__

Many challenges in a patinet journey…
mRNA != protein expression
proteogenomics very good tools..

### non-smoking lung cancer case (Cell, 2020)
	- proteogenomics revelas molecular subtypes.
	- that tools can nominate many unmet needs.
	- early detection and treatment for more cures.
	- high recurrence in "Late like" subtypes
	- ELISA diagnosis kits for early management.
	- 4-protein panel
	- blockade: different stage of patient…
	- traditional tissue proteomics (space-scale)
	- DIA based global phosphoproteomics system (GPS
	- DIA greatly reduce missing values in phopshoproteome data.
	- DIA offers high sensitivity and coverage for tissue-phosphoproteome.

### Microproteomics
	- needle biopsy

### iProChip

### Smaple size-comparable spectral libraries for low-input samples.
	- small sample should adopt the other library.
	- sample-size compatible library DIA.

### Spectronaut version17.
	- LibDIA more powerful to detect low-abundance proteins than Direct DIA.


## CS01 Multi-omics

### CS01.1. Transformin Health with Deep Data and Remote Profiing
_Keynote Speaker: Michael Snyder (Standford University)_

__Between molecules and wearbles?__

- Billions of Measurements...
- wearable device and novel algorithms can mesure outliers, even covid-19 positive from physiological data.
- People react differentially on same action.
- Wearable data (over 2,000 person) >>> multi-omics
- microsampling make the lagged correlation possible.

__Notes__

웨어러블 디바이스를 이용한 수 많은 생리학적 신호를 바탕으로 수백~수천명의
개인에게서의 데이터(DGM, step, RHR, HRV, sleep and foold log)를 융합해서 의미있는 결과를 만들 수 있었음.
제시한 예시로

1. 생리학적 신호의 outlier 가 covid-19 detection 과 연관이 있었음.
2. 밤에 쉐이크를 마셨을 때 carbohydrate score가 사람마다 다르게 나타났는데, core diabetes marker를 설명함.


### CS01.2. Population Proteomics: A Path to Precision Medicine.
_Keynote Speaker: Chris Whelan (Neuroscience Data Science J&J)_

__'precision medicine' is still a buzzword (scienfiction). why?__
- Right drug X.
- Right patient X.
  - mRNA != protein levle
- Right time X.

but proteomics possible.
- Drug
- Patient
- Time
  - Protein is dynamic.

__New Paradigm: Genomics >>> Proteomics__

- DBs: UK Biobank(UKB), PPP(Pharma Proteomics Project), pQTL
- Population proteomics is helping us translate humanity's instruction book
- Find hundreds of new therapeutic targets.
- Find more disease-specific biomarkers.
- Over 3,000 proteins from over 5,000 different individual.
- Build better diagnostics.
- 5-20 biomarkers... Proteomic prediction of common and rare diseases, medRxiv, 2023
- UK Biobank is an international research power-house, open-access

__next for population-scale proteomics__
- Greater diversity
- More disease-specific profiling
- ELISA (NULISA?) at scale
- MS, at scale
- Most importantly, complex of biology, We need to MS and integrate them.
  

__Note__

2000년대 초반부터 genomics 가 유행했는데 여전히 precision medicine은 공상과학처럼 들린다. 이 이유는 genomics 바탕의 것은 한계가 있기 때문에.
그래서 genomics 에서 조금 더 dynamic 한 proteomics 로의 전환을 시도했다.

UK Biobank 데이터와 PPP project 를 통해서 인구집단의 proteomics 


QA, 많은 제약사에서 drug의 부작용을 PTM을 통해서 제어하려고 시도 중임.
