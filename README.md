(3) Visualizing (e.g., LE(%) for global set, box plot of missed cleavage site, draw vendiagram with replication sets, volcano plot)<br/>

<Stage 2> Bioinformatic search<br/>
(3) Divided entires in few subsets by DEP (Differentially Expressed Protein)<br/>
(4) GO/KEGG enrichment test by DAVID, Clustering (Z-scored hirachical, UMAP)<br/>
(5) Orgainze data altogether in one folder<br/>

<Stage 3> Integration<br/>
From here, xMWAS, OmicsNet, Reactome were applicable<br/>
